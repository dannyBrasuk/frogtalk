# frogtalk

Variation in frog populations are a marker for environmental and climate change. Much of the record keeping (of data collected by volunteers) appears to be done initially on paper and then entered into disparate systems.  I had the idea of creating a smartphone app for capturing observations, to eliminate the paper record keeping. From the smartphone, observations would be pushed to a Cloud-based repository. Later an ETL process would bring observations into a consolidated EDW, from which it could be mapped and analyzed.

I'm working on the project from the backend EDW to the frontend, the smartphone app.  The first project to tackle is the EDW, which I'm doing with Postgres.

Next up will be the observational repositories, likely done in MongoDB. From there, I'll tackle the ETL.

Finally, I'll work on the smartphone app.

(Because this is a personal project, progress will be intermittent.)
