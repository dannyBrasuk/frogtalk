Standard date dimension table.  

Note that some elements are more germane to commercial and public sector operations than to environmental tracking. 
I left the values in anyway, One such element is the "open (for business) flag," which also happens to be specific to the business.  Adjsut as needed.

To execute:

select * FROM edw.DateDim_insert ( '01/01/2000'::date, '01/01/2031'::date, FALSE::boolean) ;

select * from edw.date_dim;
